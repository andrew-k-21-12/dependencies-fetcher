## Where am I?

This is a sandbox project to test the dependency fetcher library. 
It can also be used as an example of library's integration.


## Integration modes

The library can be integrated into this sandbox with 2 possible ways: using a local JAR or Maven Central distribution.


### Local JAR

A local JAR distribution is preferred by default. 
Compile the library (see the corresponding module's `README.md`) and you're set up.


### Maven Central

To grab the library from Maven Central, create a `local.properties` file 
or use an existing one generated by Android Studio in this folder.
Add the following property inside of this file:
```
useMavenCentral = true
```
and sync Gradle.

**FIXME: Revisit this doc in the same way as for the library!**
